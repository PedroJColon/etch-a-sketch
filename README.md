# etch-a-sketch
A etch-a-sketch-like project based upon The Odin Project Foundation Course projects.

## What It Can Do
- Set cell grid size
- Color in the blank grid to create shapes

## Features planned
- [] Randomize square colors when drawing
- [] Progressive darkening effect when drawing
- [] Randomize grid cell size button

## Known Bugs/Planned Fixes
- [] Grid expands to include more cells
    - Ideally, the cells would get smaller and still fit within the grid
- [] Does not give warning if user input a number not applicable or letters.
    - While program will run fine still, it is important to give an alert to user to indicate that it is invalid
